    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Once a curious youngster who enjoyed technology, my fascination led me to disassemble gadgets, like desktop PCs at home, and examine their internal components. An adrenaline rush came from opening my home computer or rooting gadgets to upgrade or modify the operating systems. It wasn't rocket science, but after rooting several spare phones, my friends began calling me a hacker. That marked the beginning of my exploration of different technologies. Articles and blogs about various technologies filled my free time. Switching to Linux as my daily driver and primary operating system initiated my journey into coding.</p>
    <p>Due to the limited availability of institutes that offer cybersecurity specializations or a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity in India, I took the decision to enroll myself in a Bachelor's Program of Computer Applications (BCA). In the BCA program, I explored various subjects, including computer system architecture CSA, software development and engineering, computer networks, and advanced programming languages such as Python-3, Java, C, and C++. The course was well-organized and had a striking balance between theoretical concepts and practical applications. This experience significantly broadened my understanding and exposure to the fields of software development and cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>My career aspirations involve working full-time as an Information Security Analyst for a renowned multinational and recognizing India's rapid development, which heavily relies on data for progress. I am eager to contribute to the growth of organizations by leveraging advanced technological infrastructures and implementing techniques like data analytics and big data.</p>
